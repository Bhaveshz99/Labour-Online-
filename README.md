# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [Ant design](https://ant.design/)
- [Redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
